# Text_Editor
Text Editor is a simple app used to work with texts. Provides functionalities like Flesch index, generating Markov text, edit distance, autocomplete, and spell checking.

# Current Implemented functionality
* Flesch index: is a measure of how easy a piece of text is to read.
* Markov text generator: generates new text based on the statistical patterns found in a given set of input text
* Spell checking and AutoComplete but currently works for small letters(I will improve this later).
  * I have implemented the auto complete function using the Trie data structure. see the AutoCompleteDictionaryTrie in the spelling package.
